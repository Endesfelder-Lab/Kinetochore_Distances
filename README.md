# Kinetochore_Distances
This code belongs to our work "Unraveling the kinetochore nanostructure in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using multi-color single-molecule localization microscopy", Virant et al., https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202209096. 
Our code uses using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm as implemented by Stan (Stan Development Team, 2021) and the CmdStanPy python package (Stan Development Team, 2019) to approximate the posterior distribution of CENP-A-POI distances according to our kinetochore model.
